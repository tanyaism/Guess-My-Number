# Guess-My-Number
A simple game where the end user has to guess what could my number be(which is of course pre-set in the code), built using Html, CSS and JavaScript.

The script file has a lot of commented sections which are initial versions of the code.The non-commented part is the optimised version complying with DRY code principle.
